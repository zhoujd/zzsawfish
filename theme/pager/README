 						Pager

This is the second incarnation (part 3),

{(<not old!>)}

it came to my attention that it shaded only to the right corner, 
i forgot about the other side, i've included a second theme.jl one 
for each side, because it was easier that way.


reasons why this sucks,

->all changes require a re-start, my knowledge of lisp is laughable.
->there is a certain irony in making it look like the gnome panel.
->the button is called "right..." but it is on the left.
->most names do not have any relationship to what they actually represent.
->the menu button is now a title so if you double click it the window'll 
shade to the corner 'cause it wasn't working out as it was therefore... 
->now has a shade style, ala enlightenment.
->most of the customize things have been disabled for the time being, 
	they were rather pointless. 

I include a few buttons in the buttons directory, which may or 
may not be to your liking.

The reason it's so shabby is i'm hoping someone will take pity on 
me and do it properly.
  
if not I will keep trying...

it's probably best to set the matched windows settings to 

frame style "pager" 
frame type "normal" 
->this avoids any "border only" unpleasantness

things that 'could' (but probably shouldn't) use this:
